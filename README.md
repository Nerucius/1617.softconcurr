# Concurrent Software 2017

## Part 1: OpenMP

Using the powerful library OpenMP run various tests to see if the IO bound
task of inserting and searching nodes in a Red-Black tree can be accelerated.

## Part 2: OpenCL

Image kernel processing and acceleration for pattern recognition using
the capabilities of GPUs instead of comparatively slower CPUs.
Very threaded tasks excell in many-cored GPUs, which have lower clocks but
a higher number of cores, usually in the hundreds.

## Part 3: Hadoop

Distributed computing made easy with Python map-reduce operations. Splitting
a huge csv file and first doing some processing on the Nodes before fully
assembling a final result.
